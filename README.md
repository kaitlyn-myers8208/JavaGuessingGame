# Overview

This software is a console app written in Java. It is a guessing game that gives hints to the user until they get to the correct randomly generated number.

My purpose is to develop an understanding of the basic syntax and workings of Java through creating a console program.

# Future Work

* Add a cute animatino to show loading
* Add the ability to save results and load them later (maybe to compete against yourself?)
* Add the ability to keep score across multiple 2-player games so you can do best two-out-of-three
